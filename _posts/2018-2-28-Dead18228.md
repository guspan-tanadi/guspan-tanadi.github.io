There are some remind about custom shorten url like <http://noom.io>. Not like normal shorten url is generate random string. On custom shorten url, the slug can be modified as user wish.

We can make it happen another example: <http://bit.do>.

Github also have it own like <http://git.io> only for github url.

I do some to shorten my contribution count on Wikipedia.

The contribution on Wikipedia <http://bit.do/GuspanWP> or <http://bit.do/GuTaWP>.

On the Wikipedia Bahasa Indonesia <http://bit.do/GuspanWBI> or <http://bit.do/GuTaWBI>.
