At the first i meet [Why do you contribute to open source](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/30/why-contribute-to-open-source.html) was catch no sense. But before it, i have heared the term.

Where to contribute? What it meant to be open source? Since Internet is open whomever. There are only bad or good thing.

The title of the post could be monitize become [Why do people contribute to Wikipedia](http://wikipediocracy.com/2015/10/27/why-do-people-contribute-to-wikipedia). Will have a platform.
