By HTTPS for git push not able to.

Use to buzzing around proxy thing. Look like for another requirement in case.

On Windows do as an [article](http://babel.jorgebg.com/configure-proxy-windows-7) told or not a need.

To [contrast](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) with SSH, it [will](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url) ask username and password every time connecting to github.

But this credentials can be [saved](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git). Although here is clone the repo by HTTPS, thereof SSH is used in [talking]({% post_url 2018-3-3-git-push-happen %}) to github.

Using HTTPS or SSH both the way to go.
