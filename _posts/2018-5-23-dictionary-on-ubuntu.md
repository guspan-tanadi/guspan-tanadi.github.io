The digital offline dictionary is just as a need. As it is often used.

There are KBBI, English to Indonesian, and Indonesian to English.

On Windows, Ebta Setiawan software called Kamus2 to
translate both Indonesian to English also English to Indonesian.
He also have KBBI offline that is often in used.

The lack is: they are seperate program.

On Ubuntu there are gkamus just like Kamus2 but support on Ubuntu.
The small window will not disturb other window of program.

Stardict just as must be used. Since KBBI, English to Indonesian,
and Indonesian to English in just one software. Stardict is available
on Ubuntu Software Center.

The database are here:

database [KBBI](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B4ZEmIa_v-fgcmlJcjNGbGl2R1U&export=download)

database [En-Indo](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B4ZEmIa_v-fgVzUwWjJBR2dVc2c&export=download)

database [Indo-En](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B4ZEmIa_v-fgWUdjOGV2S190dTQ&export=download)

After download the zip file, open Terminal. Do some command:

sudo unzip english-indonesian.zip -d /usr/share/stardict/dic

sudo unzip indonesian-english.zip -d /usr/share/stardict/dic

sudo unzip stardict-kbbi-2.4.2.zip -d /usr/share/stardict/dic
